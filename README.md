Contact: Alexander Hartl, Maximilian Bachl. Explainability methods and Adversarial Robustness metrics for RNNs for Intrusion Detection Systems.

This repository contains the code and the figures for the [upcoming paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09855) dealing with Explainability and Adversarial Robustness for RNNs. We perform our study in the context of Intrusion Detection Systems.

Unfortunately, due to size constraints, the datasets are missing. We'll look into ways of adding them or providing instructions for retrieving the datasets.
