	abstract = {We show that a recurrent neural network is able to learn a model to represent sequences of communications between computers on a network and can be used to identify outlier network traffic. Defending computer networks is a challenging problem and is typically addressed by manually identifying known malicious actor behavior and then specifying rules to recognize such behavior in network communications. However, these rule-based approaches often generalize poorly and identify only those patterns that are already known to researchers. An alternative approach that does not rely on known malicious behavior patterns can potentially also detect previously unseen patterns. We tokenize and compress netflow into sequences of "words" that form "sentences" representative of a conversation between computers. These sentences are then used to generate a model that learns the semantic and syntactic grammar of the newly generated language. We use Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture the complex relationships and nuances of this language. The language model is then used predict the communications between two IPs and the prediction error is used as a measurement of how typical or atyptical the observed communication are. By learning a model that is specific to each network, yet generalized to typical computer-to-computer traffic within and outside the network, a language model is able to identify sequences of network activity that are outliers with respect to the model. We demonstrate positive unsupervised attack identification performance (AUC 0.84) on the ISCX IDS dataset which contains seven days of network activity with normal traffic and four distinct attack patterns.},

	abstract = {The consolidation of encryption and big data in network communications have made deep packet inspection no longer feasible in large networks. Early attack detection requires feature vectors which are easy to extract, process, and analyze, allowing their generation also from encrypted traffic. So far, experts have selected features based on their intuition, previous research, or acritically assuming standards, but there is no general agreement about the features to use for attack detection in a broad scope. We compared five lightweight feature sets that have been proposed in the scientific literature for the last few years, and evaluated them with supervised machine learning. For our experiments, we use the UNSW-NB15 dataset, recently published as a new benchmark for network security. Results showed three remarkable findings: (1) Analysis based on source behavior instead of classic flow profiles is more effective for attack detection; (2) meta-studies on past research can be used to establish satisfactory benchmarks; and (3) features based on packet length are clearly determinant for capturing malicious activity. Our research showed that vectors currently used for attack detection are oversized, their accuracy and speed can be improved, and are to be adapted for dealing with encrypted traffic.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide excellent performance across a wide range of classification tasks, but their training requires high computational resources and is often outsourced to third parties. Recent work has shown that outsourced training introduces the risk that a malicious trainer will return a backdoored DNN that behaves normally on most inputs but causes targeted misclassifications or degrades the accuracy of the network when a trigger known only to the attacker is present. In this paper, we provide the first effective defenses against backdoor attacks on DNNs. We implement three backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate two promising defenses, pruning and fine-tuning. We show that neither, by itself, is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers. We then evaluate fine-pruning, a combination of pruning and fine-tuning, and show that it successfully weakens or even eliminates the backdoors, i.e., in some cases reducing the attack success rate to 0\% with only a 0.4\% drop in accuracy for clean (non-triggering) inputs. Our work provides the first step toward defenses against backdoor attacks in deep neural networks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733},
	abstract = {Deep learning-based techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of recognition and classification tasks. However, these networks are typically computationally expensive to train, requiring weeks of computation on many GPUs; as a result, many users outsource the training procedure to the cloud or rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned for a specific task. In this paper we show that outsourced training introduces new security risks: an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a {\textbackslash}emph\{BadNet\}) that has state-of-the-art performance on the user's training and validation samples, but behaves badly on specific attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of BadNets in a toy example, by creating a backdoored handwritten digit classifier. Next, we demonstrate backdoors in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special sticker is added to the stop sign; we then show in addition that the backdoor in our US street sign detector can persist even if the network is later retrained for another task and cause a drop in accuracy of \{25\}{\textbackslash}\% on average when the backdoor trigger is present. These results demonstrate that backdoors in neural networks are both powerful and---because the behavior of neural networks is difficult to explicate---stealthy. This work provides motivation for further research into techniques for verifying and inspecting neural networks, just as we have developed tools for verifying and debugging software.},

	title = {Trojaning {Attack} on {Neural} {Networks}},
	abstract = {With the fast spread of machine learning techniques, sharing and adopting public machine learning models become very popular. This gives attackers many new opportunities. In this paper, we propose a trojaning attack on neuron networks. As the models are not intuitive for human to understand, the attack features stealthiness. Deploying trojaned models can cause various severe consequences including endangering human lives (in applications like auto driving). We first inverse the neuron network to generate a general trojan trigger, and then retrain the model with external datasets to inject malicious behaviors to the model. The malicious behaviors are only activated by inputs stamped with the trojan trigger. In our attack, we do not need to tamper with the original training process, which usually takes weeks to months. Instead, it takes minutes to hours to apply our attack. Also, we do not require the datasets that are used to train the model. In practice, the datasets are usually not shared due to privacy or copyright concerns. We use five different applications to demonstrate the power of our attack, and perform a deep analysis on the possible factors that affect the attack. The results show that our attack is highly effective and efficient. The trojaned behaviors can be successfully triggered (with nearly 100\% possibility) without affecting its test accuracy for normal input data. Also, it only takes a small amount of time to attack a complex neuron network model. In the end, we also discuss possible defense against such attacks.},

	title = {Bagging classifiers for fighting poisoning attacks in adversarial environments},
	abstract = {Abstract. Pattern recognition systems have been widely used in ad-versarial classification tasks like spam filtering and intrusion detection in computer networks. In these applications a malicious adversary may successfully mislead a classifier by “poisoning ” its training data with carefully designed attacks. Bagging is a well-known ensemble construc-tion method, where each classifier in the ensemble is trained on a different bootstrap replicate of the training set. Recent work has shown that bag-ging can reduce the influence of outliers in training data, especially if the most outlying observations are resampled with a lower probability. In this work we argue that poisoning attacks can be viewed as a particu-lar category of outliers, and, thus, bagging ensembles may be effectively exploited against them. We experimentally assess the effectiveness of bagging on a real, widely used spam filter, and on a web-based intrusion detection system. Our preliminary results suggest that bagging ensem-bles can be a very promising defence strategy against poisoning attacks, and give us valuable insights for future research work. 1},
